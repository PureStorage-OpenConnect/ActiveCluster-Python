This is an example for an Active Cluster configuration with two Arrays
There are two scripts. One for the initial hosts and host groups configuration. Another for additional volume creation and mapping to the host groups

definition_UK.py contains the definition for your clusters. Name, IP and token. Customize this for your setup
Cluster_UK.py contains the host group, the hosts and the WWN for each one. It also include the volume sizes to be created.
If you have more volumes to create after the initial setup, simply add the sizes needed

create_host.py add the hosts to each array and create a Host Group with those hosts in each of the arrays

create_volume_and_map_hostg.py will create the volumes specified, will rename them with the hostgroup name and the last 4 IDs of the volume and will map them to hosts in each array
